This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using data science techniques. By analyzing historical data and customer behavior patterns, we'll develop a model to forecast which customers are likely to churn in the future.

##Dataset
The dataset contains demographic data, usage patterns, service subscriptions, and churn status of telecom customers.

##Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distributions, correlations, and identifying key factors influencing churn.
Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features for modeling.
Model Development: Building predictive models using techniques like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters to improve performance.
Deployment: Deploying the final model for real-time predictions.
